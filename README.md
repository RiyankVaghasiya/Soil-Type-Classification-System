# üå± Soil Type Classification System

A machine learning project that classifies different types of soil (e.g., **Alluvial**, **Black**, **Red**, **Sandy**, etc.) using classical machine learning models. This system uses **image processing** techniques (color histograms) for feature extraction and applies algorithms like **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Random Forest** for classification.

## üß† Problem Statement

Farmers and agronomists often struggle with identifying soil types accurately without laboratory testing. This project aims to build an **automated soil classification system** that predicts the type of soil from an image using classical ML techniques.

## üß™ Technologies Used

- Python üêç
- OpenCV (Image Processing)
- NumPy & Pandas (Data handling)
- Scikit-learn (ML Models)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
- `dill` (for saving models & objects)
- HTML/CSS (UI Designing)
- VS Code (IDE)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Reads raw image files from `data/raw/soil-types/` and labels them based on folder names.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Resizes images to `128x128`
   - Extracts color histogram features in HSV space
   - Encodes labels numerically
   - Saves processed `X.pkl` and `y.pkl`

3. **Model Training**  
   - Uses algorithms like `SVM`, `RandomForest`, etc.
   - Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`
   - Saves the best performing model as `model.pkl`

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluates on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
   - Achieved up to **41% accuracy** (can be improved using deep learning)
